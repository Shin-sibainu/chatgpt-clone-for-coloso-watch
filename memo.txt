For easy scalability and maintenance, organize most of the code within the features folder. 
Each feature folder should contain code specific to that feature, keeping things neatly separated. 
This approach helps prevent mixing feature-related code with shared components, 
making it simpler to manage and maintain the codebase compared to having many files in a flat folder structure.
By adopting this method, you can enhance collaboration, readability, and scalability in the application's architecture.

A feature could have the following structure:

```sh
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types used within the feature
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
